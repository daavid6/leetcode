# LeetCode Daily Problem Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode daily challenge repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to improving my coding logic and tracking my progress as I tackle LeetCode's daily problems. I solve at least one problem every day, grouped by difficulty, and upload my solutions here. The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills and keep my GitHub profile active with consistent activity.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three categories based on the difficulty level of the problems:

    ┬──easy/
    ├──medium/
    └──hard/
        └── {problem_number}/
              ├── {problem_number}.java
              └── README.md


- Each folder is named after the problem number.
- The `.java` file contains the solution to the problem.
- The `README.md` in each folder provides the problem description, examples, metrics of my solution and an explanation of the solution if necessary.

## 🔥 Why This Repo?

- **Consistency**: My goal is to solve a LeetCode problem every day!
- **Learning**: Each solution is a reflection of my thought process and code optimization, targeting a wide range of data structures and algorithms.
- **Growth**: Tracking my progress to see how my approach evolves over time.
- **Engagement**: Maintaining an active GitHub profile with daily commits and solutions.

## 📊 Problem Categories

| Difficulty |
|------------|
| Easy       |
| Medium     |
| Hard       |

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Java (Primary language for solutions)
